# Software for Scoring
These are software tools that were discovered to be useful while scoring for films.

The installed tools are listed below


## Handbrake
  [Homepage](https://handbrake.fr/)

  Handbrake is an easy-to-use audio and video encoder. This is a great way to
  make video and music files take up less memory, much less than if you zipped them,
  and maintains a high quality

## FFMPEG
  [Homepage](https://ffmpeg.org/)

  The typical use case for this is converting .aiff files to .mp3 files, as Handbrake does not offer this conversion.
  FFMPEG is a ubiquitous audio/video encoder/converter/streaming software. It actually provides the backend
  for Handbrake, but this command-line version allows for total control, including a wider variety of files to encode from/to.

## WeShare
  [Homepage](https://wetransfer.com/) 
  
  WeTransfer is a freemium utility for sharing large files (up to 2GB on the free tier). It allows you to send it directly to an email,
  or create a link from which anyone can download your file. The premium version pushes the limit per message to 20GB, among other nice features.
